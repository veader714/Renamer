# Renamer

TODO: A lot....

1. TVDB proper error handling
2. Proper episode season and number detection
    - Unknown formats
    - XXX format
    - episode xxx format
3. Should this move files or should megaGet server do that???
4. DB for current show and ep info (RO on renamer and write on megaGet server)
5. Renamer should be able to work independently of both the server and DB.
6. Commandline tools
